## üß™ Description

The code in this repository performs high-order QED calculations for positronium, focusing on:

- Three-photon annihilation contributions to energy levels.
- Light-by-light scattering effects in two-photon annihilation channels.
- Vacuum polarization corrections in annihilation processes.

These calculations are essential for refining theoretical predictions of positronium energy levels and decay rates, providing stringent tests of bound-state QED.
